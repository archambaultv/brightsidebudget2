# Brightside Budget 2
ðŸŽ¶ Always look on the bright side of your finance ðŸŽ¶

Brightside Budget is my personal Haskell library for managing my finances.

## Library Overview
This is not a complete plain text accounting program. The library includes all
the common functionalities I need to manage my finances, and I write scripts to
automate regular tasks.

The core concept is storing data in CSV files, which are easy to work with in
Excel and version control with Git. The library provides a Journal datatype that
includes accounts, transactions, balance assertions, and budget targets, along
with various methods to manipulate these objects. Additionally, it offers
essential functionalities for importing, exporting, and deduplicating
transactions.
